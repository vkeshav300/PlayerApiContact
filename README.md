## Using The Package:
### To Import:
```
from HypixelPlayerApi import plr
```
### How to instantiate
```
obj = plr.Player([<(Player UUID-Dashed) or (Player Username)>, <(UUID) or (USERNAME)>], <API_KEY>)
```
In argument 1, you input a list, with the player's uuid-dashed or username as the first element in the list, and then you enter a string telling the program that you entered the UUID or Username. You will see examples at the end of the `How to instantiate` section.
To get the `uuid_dashed` of a player, just go to a website like namemc.com and search up the player's username. It should give you their `uuid` & `uuid_dashed`. To get the `API_KEY`, type `/api` in a Hypixel server. If your `API_KEY` gets leaked, create a new one.

```
obj = plr.Player(['TestUser123', 'USERNAME'], <API_KEY>) # With USERNAME
```
```
obj = plr.Player(['abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz', 'UUID'], <API_KEY>) # With UUID-Dashed
```

### Code Examples:
```
PlayerData = obj.get_hypixel_stats() # Returns Hypixel player data
```
```
SkyblockData = obj.get_skyblock_data(<Profile>) # Returns Hypixel Skyblock data for the inputted profile
```
